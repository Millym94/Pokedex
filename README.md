# Pokedex
Goal - To build a functional PokeDex using Poke-API

The PokeDex uses an API to fetch Pokemons. Once a Pokemon is selected from the "modal"(list), a pop modal shows with the Pokemons :

Name
Image of Pokemon
Height
Ability
Type

Can also use the search bar on the top right corner to type the name of the Pokemon you'd like to "fetch" 

Used : jQuery Bootstrap

Linters : ESLint
